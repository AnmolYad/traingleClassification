# traingleClassification
Classify a triangle based on length of three sides
Input will be three integers
First declare three variables of integer type for three side of a triangle 
Then the inputs is taken from user by using scanner(import.java.util.Scanner).
If and else condtion will be there to check the different conditions for these program.
First condition shows that the sum of the two  sides of the triangle should be greater than the third side.
Second condition shows if all the sides of a triangle are equal than it is called an equilateral triangle.
Third condition shows us that if any two sides are equal to each other than the triangle is called an isoceleus triangle.
If above  conditions are not satisfy then output will be the scalene triangle means none of the sides are equal to each other.
Then output will be a string representing the class of a triangle.
